> Allocation of various relief supplies in the flood hit areas of Assam using data obtained by IMD, DFO and EM-DAT

# Missing Data

Initially we had lot of missing data which we had to extract from the extent and description column given in our dataset of Indian Flood Inventory. We used various techniques to fulfill this data to get more insight of the floods' impact in Assam.

# Focus on Assam

We chose Assam as our region of study as it had the highest occurence of flood among all states.
